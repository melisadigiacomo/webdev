        <h2>Best view of Cordoba</h2>

        <p>“ On the way there are 6 breaks. On the 5th there is shelter. If I remember correctly when you arrive at
          the refuge you are more or less in the middle of the journey. Up to that point the trail is pretty quiet
          without too much hassle, I would say pretty much anyone can get there. From there it gets a lot more
          demanding, it is steep and there are no more smooth sections. At the top the view
          is incredible so it is worth the effort. The descent is the hardest part. ”</p>

        <h2>Such incredible experience. Highly recommended!</h2>

        <p>“ It is a fascinating place with beautiful views, the climate is very changeable. The path to get there is
          very well defined, although it has medium complications on the ground, with patience and perseverance you
          reach the top. Good advise: bring water (2L at least) and light clothing. There are 6
          breaks to the top. At the 5th break there is a refuge. From the 6th to the top the road is more complex. Try
          to go up as early as possible. We left the base at 7.30 am and we did most of the climb without any sun. The
          entrance is very expensive, and you have to pay for parking. With the entrance you have absolutely nothing
          included, it is only the permission to climb. Nevertheless, the experiences is incredible. I highly recommend!

        <p>“ Incredible place. The road wasn't easy, but I think it is possible. Do not give up and enjoy the tour. I am
          not a sports fan and I was able to get there. All that sacrifice will worth it! Unique and fantastic place. It
          is very important to bring water! Also fruits and cereal bars! Always carry the garbage with you. ”
